If you’re looking to send messages on Aptos, a blockchain platform, you can use its APIs or smart contracts to interact with the blockchain. However, if you're specifically looking for code examples or a repository related to sending messages, you might want to look at the Aptos SDK or example projects in their official repositories.

You can find relevant repositories and examples in the Aptos GitHub organization:

1. *Aptos SDK*: This repository includes various tools and libraries for interacting with the Aptos blockchain.
   - GitHub: [Aptos SDK](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core)

2. *Aptos Examples*: This repository includes example projects that demonstrate how to interact with Aptos.
   - GitHub: [Aptos Examples](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/examples)

Look for example smart contracts or scripts related to message sending or transaction management. For specific use cases, you may need to look into how Aptos handles messaging through smart contracts or transactions. If there’s no direct example for sending messages, you might need to adapt general transaction handling code for your purposes.
